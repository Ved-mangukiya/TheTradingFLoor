# CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS — THE TRADING FLOOR CHAMPIONSHIP 2026

**Date**: 2026-10-17  
**Version**: 2.3.0 (Dynamic Event Upgrade: Dynamic Team Capacity $N \ge 1$, Post-Lock Day 1 Launch Modal, 5-Phase News Flow, Simulation Risk Profiles, Minimalist Student Login, Dramatic & Intense Winner Reveal Animations & Sound)  
**Status**: PRODUCTION-READY, FULLY IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED (63/63 Automated Tests Passing: 11 Dynamic + 52 Master Suite)  

---

## 1. Architectural Principle: ONE ACTION = ONE CLEAR PLACE = ONE AUTHORITATIVE IMPLEMENTATION
- [x] **4 Primary Host Navigation Hubs**:
  1. `🏠 1. Home`: Status overview, connection monitor (Traders, Projector, Sound), Readiness Checklist, and single dynamic Next Step guidance.
  2. `⚙️ 2. Event`: 6-step guided setup wizard (`Details -> Teams -> Companies -> Schedule -> News Plan -> Review & Lock`), real company selection, auto-generated news plan, automatic readiness validation, and single safe `Unlock Configuration` control.
  3. `📈 3. Live Market`: Canonical single Market Operations Bar (`▶ Resume 3-2-1`, `⏸ Pause`, `🕶️ Blackout`, `🏁 Conclude Session`), real-time stock boards, News Control Centre with 60-second privacy reveal, and live trade stream.
  4. `🖥️ 4. Stage & Results`: Auditorium Projector Remote (Auto-Cycle / Fixed Screen / Board Page Controls), Venue Sound Console controls, Disaster Recovery & Checkpoint Matrix, Leaderboard results, audited CSV/JSON reports, and Safe Championship Reset card.
- [x] **Zero Action Duplication**: Consolidated floating/overview pause and resume buttons into one canonical Live Market bar. Removed duplicate news editors, duplicate company pickers, and redundant launchers.

---

## 2. Automatic Configuration Locking & Safe Pre-Competition Unlock
- [x] **Automatic Readiness Validation**: Checks all required fields (title, starting cash, fees, company selection, schedule, and balanced news plan).
- [x] **Automatic Lock on Valid Draft**: Transitions state to `Ready — Locked` with simple English notice:
  *"Your event setup is complete. Settings are now locked to protect competition fairness."*
- [x] **Safe Unlock (`HOST_UNLOCK_EVENT_CONFIG`)**:
  - Permitted only before the tournament starts (`gameState.status === 'STANDBY' && gameState.elapsedSeconds === 0`).
  - Once live trading begins or seconds elapse, permanently freezes event configuration. Any unlock attempt returns clear explanation:
    *"Cannot unlock settings: The competition has already started. Event settings are permanently frozen during live trading."*

---

## 3. Automatic News Plan Generation from Selected Companies
- [x] **Host Selects Companies — Engine Selects News**: The host selects participating companies from the verified Indian listed universe (`RELIANCE`, `TATAMOTORS`, `TCS`, `HDFCBANK`, etc.).
- [x] **Auto News Plan (`HOST_GENERATE_AUTO_NEWS_PLAN`)**:
  - Uses `NEWS_TEMPLATE_LIBRARY` (10 rich sector/macro templates with neutral headlines in plain English).
  - Strictly targets selected companies (zero leakage of unselected companies into impacts).
  - Generates balanced, multi-day schedules with deterministic timing fractions.
- [x] **Neutral Public Headlines**: Formatted in objective wire language without buy/sell advice (e.g. *"Ministry of Heavy Industries Outlines Updated Production and Component Sourcing Guidelines"*).

---

## 4. Confidentiality & 60-Second Private Impact Reveal Model
- [x] **Default Private Impact Masking**: Private price impact percentages (`+11.5%`, `-3.5%`) are masked by default in the host interface as `[🔒 Private Price Impact Details Hidden]`.
- [x] **Zero Public Leakage**: Trader workstations and auditorium projector never receive private impact percentages or directional targets over WebSocket.
- [x] **60-Second Reveal Window**:
  - Clicking `👁️ Reveal Private News Details` displays permitted impact percentages and activates a visible 60-second countdown banner (`⚠️ Private event information is visible. It will hide automatically in 60s.`).
  - Features immediate `🔒 Hide Now` button.
  - Automatically re-masks all private details when the timer expires or when the host navigates away from the Market tab.

---

## 5. Smoothstep Stock Price Movement Engine
- [x] **Mathematical Smoothstep Formulation**:
  $$u = \text{clamp}\left(\frac{t - t_0}{T}, 0, 1\right), \quad s(u) = 3u^2 - 2u^3, \quad P(t) = P_0 + (P_T - P_0) \cdot s(u)$$
- [x] **Continuous Server-Time Basis**: Computed using exact elapsed milliseconds (`Date.now() - stock.activeTransition.startTimeMs`), rendering the engine completely immune to tick delay drift.
- [x] **Non-Snapping Trajectory Transition**: When a new shock arrives during an active transition, the new trajectory begins from the current official price $P_0 = P_{\text{current}}$, eliminating jarring price snaps.
- [x] **Realistic Reaction Window**: Durations calibrated (15s to 60s) allowing participants to read news and execute trades while prices evolve.

---

## 6. Projector Redesign: Zero-Scroll Pagination & Spotlight Bar
- [x] **Zero-Scroll Stock Board Pagination**:
  - Automatically partitions the active stock universe into readable 8-card pages ($4 \times 2$ responsive grid) with `overflow: hidden`.
  - Automatically rotates to the next page every 8 seconds with smooth CSS transitions.
  - In-place DOM and sparkline updates ensure price ticks never restart rotation timers or cause canvas flickering.
- [x] **Permanently Visible Spotlight Bar**:
  - **Top Percentage Gainer**: Displays ticker, current price, and percentage change. Deterministic alphabetical tie-break prevents jitter.
  - **Top Percentage Loser**: Displays ticker, current price, and percentage change.
  - **Market Breadth**: Live counter of Advancing, Declining, and Unchanged stocks across the universe.
  - **Pagination Controls**: Displays "Page X of Y", visual dot indicators, and Host remote controls (`◀ Prev`, `⏸ Pause/Resume`, `▶ Next`).

---

## 7. Disaster Recovery & Checkpoint Engine
- [x] **Periodic & Manual Snapshots**:
  - Auto-checkpoints every 120 seconds during live market sessions saved to `data/checkpoints/`.
  - Host can capture instant named checkpoints via `HOST_CREATE_CHECKPOINT`.
- [x] **One-Click & File Upload Restore**:
  - Host can inspect and restore any previous checkpoint directly from the Stage & Results hub.
  - Supports uploading exported JSON backup files from an external USB drive.
- [x] **Safe Restored State Invariant**:
  - Upon restore, market status is forced to `PAUSED` waiting for Host Resume 3-2-1.
  - All connected trader and projector terminals receive `MARKET_RESTORED` notice and refresh their portfolios cleanly.

---

## 8. Safe Championship Reset with Mandatory Client Logout
- [x] **Strict Confirmation Phrase**: Requires explicit `"RESET CHAMPIONSHIP"` (or `'RESET'`) input, rejecting any mismatched confirmation.
- [x] **Mandatory Full-Screen Client Notification**:
  *"The host has reset the competition. You have been logged out. Please wait for the host to set up a new event."*
- [x] **Trader Session Invalidation**: Immediately invalidates active trader sessions server-side to prevent stale orders from executing, displays full-screen overlay `#clientResetModal`, and cleanly redirects to login.

---

## 9. Verification & Test Suite Status
- [x] `test_dynamic_upgrade_suite.js`: **11/11 PASSED (100%)** (Event status API, host login, 4-team dynamic lock, custom team passwords, invalid desk rejection, 3-2-1 post-lock trigger, solo 1-team lock, solo login).
- [x] `test_master_suite.js`: **52/52 PASSED (100%)** (Comprehensive 10-stage end-to-end regression across orders, circuit breakers, news engine, checkpoints, reset, and exports).
- [x] **Total Automated Verification**: **63/63 Passing Tests (0 Failures)**.
